            To this point, I have been able to complete several small projects through my bootcamp. Below are a few that I believe truly showcase my skills.
        </p>
        <p1>
            The first example was a very recent team-based project that had the three of us create a working library check system. We had to use different classes and methods to write and rewrite to a text file, which would tell us what books were checked in or out.

        <a href="https://github.com/Jplane91/LibraryMidtermRefactored">Library Check System</a>
        </div4>
        <p2>
            The second example is one of our first labs that had us create a mathematical powers table and have it formatted. This was the first time I have used the Math class.
